# J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Map

The J.N. “Ding” Darling National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Map is a responsive web mapping application which shows the roads, trails, parking lots, and points of interest within J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge in Sanibel, Florida. The refuge is the largest undeveloped mangrove ecosystem in the United States. It is known as "America's Birding Hotspot", famous for its rookery islands filled with roseate spoonbills, pelicans, herons, egrets, and ibises. It is also home to iconic Florida wildlife, including the Florida manatee, bottlenose dolphin, and American alligator. What makes “Ding” Darling so special is how easy it is to see such a vast diversity of unique and endangered species.

The interactive visitor map is focused on the themes of general tourism and ecotourism and shows users the refuge boundary, roads, trails, points of interest, and birding hotspots from eBird. Users can click any feature to get more information, filter the points of interest by category or location, view wildlife observations submitted by other visitors, and submit their own sightings. Users within the park and the immediately surrounding area can also see their current location on the map, filter the points of interest to those within 1/2 mile of their current location, and submit wildlife observations at their current location.

The mobile-friendly layout is compatible with any desktop computer, tablet, or phone with internet access.

Note: Submitting data requires the use of a CARTO API key, which is secured behind a proxy and needs to be run on a PHP server. The application can be run by installing <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>, starting a local PHP server, and navigating to http://localhost/ding-darling-nwr/index.html.
